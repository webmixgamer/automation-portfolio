#  Telegram Bot for Extracting Image Embeddings

This bot listens to a specific Telegram group and automatically processes incoming images. It converts them to base64, sends them to an OpenCLIP model via API, and logs the resulting vector embeddings into a Google Sheet, along with Telegram metadata.

---

##  Features

- Listens for image messages in a Telegram group
- Downloads the image and converts to Base64
- Sends image to OpenCLIP model API and retrieves embeddings
- Stores the vector, message ID, and timestamp in Google Sheets
- Built on n8n with reliable modular workflow

##  Tech Stack

- **n8n**
- **Telegram Bot API**
- **Google Sheets API**
- **OpenCLIP / HuggingFace Inference API**
- JavaScript / JSON
- `.env` for secret keys

##  Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Create `.env` file using `.env.example`
3. Fill in your API keys:
   - Telegram Bot Token
   - HuggingFace API key (or your inference endpoint)
4. Import `workflow.json` into your n8n instance
5. Run and monitor in n8n UI
